          <p class="big">This website was created for tiny house owners and enthusiasts. As the tiny house community continues to grow and myself being someone who has built my own tiny house I thought it would be nice to create a place where we can all come together and share our stories and maybe share some building tips. We have a forum here as well for diving deeper into various topics you would like to discuss. Thank you for visiting Tiny Spot.</p>
